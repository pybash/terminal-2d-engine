# terminal-2d-engine
Terminal 2D Engine, requires spamming Enter whenever wanting to make a key input. Would be better in HTML with OnKey events.<br>
<br>
Engine made for kingaasohk's request.<br>
## To note
Strict dict, if key is missing then all fails<br>
Requires spamming of enter since its basically a terminal application<br>
My tests were performed on Python 3.8.1 (64-bit) but should work on 3.x<br>
Map size can be dynamic, but there has to be borders.
